## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The codes is written in Python 3. To run the codes, please make sure you have installed some libraries, like numpy, pandas, seaborn, etc.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the bank customer churn to address the questions below:

1. What are the main factors, which affect the customer churn?
2. How does these main factors affect the customer churn?
3. Which is the best method to predict the churn (using Logistic regression, Decision tree, SVM, and Random forest)?
4. Whether the SMOTE method can improve the prediction accuracy?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 Jupyter notebooks available here to answer the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
